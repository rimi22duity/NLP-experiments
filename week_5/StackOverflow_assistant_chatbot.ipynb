We already had `question_to_vec` function from the assignment 3, which can create such a representation based on word vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it would be costly to compute such a representation for all possible answers in *online mode* of the bot (e.g. when bot is running and answering questions from many users). This is the reason why you will create a database with pre-computed representations. These representations will be arranged by non-overlaping tags (programming languages), so that the search of the answer can be performed only within one tag each time. This will make our bot even more efficient and allow not to store all the database in RAM.\n",

        "Load StarSpace embeddings which were trained on Stack Overflow posts. These embeddings were trained in *supervised mode *for duplicates detection on the same corpus that is used in search. We can account on that these representations will allow us to find closely related answers for a question.\n",

        "If for some reasons you didn't train StarSpace embeddings in the assignment 3, you can use [pre-trained word vectors](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) from Google. All instructions about how to work with these vectors were provided in the same assignment. However, we highly recommend to use StarSpace's embeddings, because it contains more appropriate embeddings. If you chose to use Google's embeddings, delete the words, which are not in Stackoverflow data."
